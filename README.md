# D&D Named Encounters Generator

An enhanced D&D encounter generator that creates unique monster names and party motivations, built using React and based on the logic from dnd-encounters-24.

## Features

### âœ¨ Enhanced Encounter Generation
- **No Theme Restrictions**: Uses all available monsters regardless of campaign theme
- **Four Encounter Types**: 
  - Dragon or Legendary (single powerful creature)
  - Mounts and Riders (mounted combat encounters)
  - Groups (same creature type in numbers)
  - Mixed Groups (leader + minions)

### ðŸŽ­ Enhanced Monster Names
- **Cultural Name Generation**: Uses 5 distinct cultural naming systems (Aquilonian, Barbarian, Oriental, Lusitanian, Q'haran)
- **Personal Names**: Generates culturally authentic personal names like "Karim al-Din" or "Lancelot the Ancient"
- **Atmospheric Titles**: Context-aware titles based on monster type (Dragons get "Stormcaller", Fiends get "the Corrupted")
- **Syllable-Based Generation**: Sophisticated name creation using authentic linguistic patterns
- **Monster Type Awareness**: Names reflect creature nature (Noble for Celestials, Dark for Undead)
- **Preserve Original Stats**: Original names preserved for mechanical reference

### ðŸŽ¯ Party Motivations
- **8 Motivation Categories**: Territorial, Hunger, Treasure, Vengeance, Orders, Curiosity, Madness, Survival
- **Contextual Explanations**: Provides narrative reasons why the party encounters these monsters
- **Story Integration**: Helps DMs weave encounters into the ongoing narrative

### ðŸ“Š Clean Table Layout
- **Professional Tables**: Clean, sortable displays instead of text lists
- **Monster Details**: Name, Display Name, Type/Role, CR, and encounter details
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works well on all screen sizes

### ðŸ’¾ Local Data Persistence
- **Save Encounters**: Keep your favorite encounters for reuse
- **Browser Storage**: Uses localStorage - no server required
- **Export/Import Ready**: Stored as JSON for easy backup
